    <p class="justify">I love to ski, swim, and play volleyball. In the winter skiing is definately my favorite hobby. I find it very relaxing to be out in the snow among the trees. In the summer, however, I enjoy volleyball and being in the water. I did swim team in highschool bu I also enjoy doing it just for fun.</p>
